# Vote4Film

Simplify film selection for regular film nights. Participants can:

- Add films
- Vote for films
- Declare absences
- See the schedule which takes into account votes and absences

Admins can set the schedule of film nights.

This is a simple WSGI Web Application. The back-end is Django, and the front-end
is dynamic HTML served by Django (no JavaScript is used).

## Development

1. `poetry install` to set-up the virtualenv (one-off)
2. `poetry run ./src/vote4film/manage.py migrate` to set-up the local DB (one-off)
3. `poetry run ./src/vote4film/manage.py runserver_plus`
4. `make fix`, `make check` and `make test` before committing

### Contributing

Pull requests are welcome :)

### Publishing

This application is published on PyPi.

1. Ensure you have configured the PyPi repository with Poetry (one-off)
2. Add the release notes in this README.md
3. `poetry version minor` to bump the major/minor/patch version
4. `poetry publish --build` to release

To publish to the test repository:

1. Ensure you have configured the Test PyPi repository with Poetry (one-off)
2. `poetry publish --build -r testpypi` to upload to the test repository

## Deployment

Unfortunately, I will not provide detailed guidance for production deployment.

Some general tips:

* Create a virtualenv, e.g. in `~/virtualenv`
* Install with `pip install vote4film[postgres]`
* Write the configuration at `~/.config/vote4film/local.env`
* Use Postgres as the database
* Use Nginx/uWSGI to to serve the site (with HTTPS)
* Run Django management commands using `./virtualenv/bin/manage`
